## Getting Started

### What is [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com)?

Alfresco is an open-source content management application. This project provides some tools for 
setting up and working with Alfresco extension/enhancement projects. It wraps and extends the
Alfresco SDK and specifically the All in One maven archetype.

### What is [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)?

Yeoman is a command line tool that helps you to automate coding tasks. Out of the box, Yeoman 
doesn't do very much. It relies on a library of thousands of 
[generators](http://yeoman.io/generators/) to actually perform the coding tasks for you.

Yeoman lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. Assuming you have a recent
version of [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) installed, you can use the following command
to install Yeoman.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Installing and using the generator

You have a couple of options for installing the Alfresco generator for Yeoman. Your choice will 
depend on if you plan to extend the generator or if you simply want to use it.

> _Checkout the next section for what to do if you plan to work on the generator code._

We have not pushed a version of the Alfresco generator to npmjs.org yet, so if you don't 
plan to make changes to the generator itself, run:

```bash
npm install -g binduwavell/generator-alfresco
```

WARNING: you will likely need to update this occasionally as the project is under active 
development.

Now, assuming you have all of the pre-requisites installed (including appropriate
versions of node, npm, yeoman, this generator, Java and Maven.) You can create an 
Alfresco extension project using this generator. First of all you should create a 
new folder for your project and change into the new folder. Then run the following 
command:

```bash
yo alfresco
```

This will ask you a number of questions and then generate a project based on your
answers.

```bash
yo alfresco --help
```

Will print out information about cli arguments and options. It will also list the
sub-generators we have completed.

```bash
yo alfresco:amp
```

This will ask a few questions and then create additional repo/share source AMPs
and plug them into your project files (including maven and  spring/tomcat contexts.)

We still need to add the ability to integrate pre-packaged AMPs from the /amps
and /amps_share folders and from remote maven repositories to this sub-generator.

```bash
yo alfresco:webscript
```

This will ask you a bunch of questions and then produce appropriate repo/share files
for your WebScript. If you choose multiple methods you can in fact scaffold multiple
webscripts with one pass through this sub-generator.

We are planning to add many more sub-generators for things like: content models,
repo actions, behaviors, jobs, workflows, etc.

### Try The Project / Contribute

Before reporting issues or working on fixes/enhancements, please make sure you are
familiar with and agree to our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#readme).

If you plan to to make changes to the generator itself, there are detailed
instructions in the [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md#readme) page. 

If you are particularly impatient, you have a couple options options for a quick
start. You can check out the generator-alfresco project (or ideally a fork of the same)
and then run the following command from the checked out project directory:

```bash
npm install
npm link # may need sudo
```

This is essentially the same as the ```npm install -g binduwavell/generator-alfresco```
command above, but you'll have a project directory where you can tweak things, and
push updates back to GitHub.

Another super low effort option to getting started quickly is to open a clone of this project 
in Codenvy (a cloud IDE), by clicking this badge: 
[![create project on Codenvy][codenvy-image]][codenvy-url]. 

Clicking the button will create a temporary workspace at Codenvy with a clone of this project, 
allowing you to run the generator in an embedded docker container called a runner. 
You can make edits to the generator-alfresco project, test them and send pull requests right
from your browser. You can even run the generated Alfresco All-In-One community project 
produced by the generator in the runner. Other than your browser, this is a zero install option.

WARNING: The workspace at Codenvy generated by this link is temporary, **persist** it if you want 
to save your work for later.

Here is a video showing the process:
