> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

<!--
To install generator-alfresco from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-alfresco
```
-->

We have not pushed a version of the Alfresco generator to npmjs.org yet, so you need to clone this project and then:

```bash
npm install
npm link # may need sudo
```

Finally, in a new folder you wish to generate a project in, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo alfresco
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. 
If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced, check out the complete 
[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
