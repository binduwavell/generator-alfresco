> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

<!--
To install generator-alfresco from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-alfresco
```
-->

We have not pushed a version to npmjs.org yet, so you need to clone this project and then:

```bash
npm install
npm link # may need sudo
```

Finally, in a new folder you wish to generate a project in, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo alfresco
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

[![create project on Codenvy](https://codenvy.com/factory/resources/factory-white.png)](https://codenvy.com/factory?id=zmv24wynr689af6f). 

Clicking the button will create a temporary workspace at Codenvy with a clone of this project, allowing you to run the generator in an 
embedded docker container, run the Alfresco All-In-One project produced by the generator. It will even allow you to make edits to the 
generator-alfresco project, test them and ultimately send pull requests.

As the workspace is temporary, don't forget to save it if you want to save your work for later.

Here is a video showing the process:
