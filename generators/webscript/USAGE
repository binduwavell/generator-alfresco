Notes:
  The module-path option should be specified as a relative path from the root of
  your project to the folder that contains the pom.xml file for your module. Say
  you used 'yo alfresco:module' to create a repository module called
  client-repo-amp directly in the customizations folder. In this case you would
  provide the value 'customizations/client-repo-amp'.
