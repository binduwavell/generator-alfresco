customizations
==============

As this folder exists, we will store the source for amps and modules you 
are coding under this folder. This organization is particularly useful 
for complex projects that have lots of AMPs and JARs.

There are also folders here for including pre-packaged amps and jars.
These use the same naming convention as the Alfresco installer. They are
`amps` and `amps_share`.

The `modules` folder structure is included as a place to place 
pre-packaged jar customizations. The features for linking 
these into projects have not been implemented yet.
