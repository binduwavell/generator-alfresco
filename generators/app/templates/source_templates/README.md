source\_templates
================

When the ```yo alfresco``` generator first setup this project, it copied the
default source modules (likely repo-amp and share-amp) structures created by 
maven here. The ```yo alfresco:amp``` sub-generator utilizes these copies as 
the bases for new source amp generaton.
